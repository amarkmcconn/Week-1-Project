code review template for first code review at Epicodus - Git, HTML, and CSS

Instructions:
- fork this repo (here's how)
- clone your fork
- continue working in main? yea
  - teacher grading script needs to only consider git commits after the fork


- bootstrap has been added but you are not required to use it 

You may not know what these things mean but don't worry we will learn about them several weeks later in the program. For now all you need to do
- npm install (just once)

- to run grading script 
  -chmod +x
  - ./grading_script.sh

  this will create an review.md file that is added to your gitignore (so it won't go to your remote repo)

  before you get started:
  - rename this repo (here's how)
  - delete everything in this README and write your own

  the package and grading script files, eslintrc are not a part of your project - don't touch anything in them.

Requirements
- node 12 or higher, npm 6 or higher as part of the preowrk
