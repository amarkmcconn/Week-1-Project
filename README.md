# Epicodus

## Code Review Template: Git, HTML & CSS

### Requirements: 
- node 12 or higher, npm 6 or higher as part of the preowrk


### Instructions:

1. fork this repo (here's how)
2. rename the project now on your github (here's how)
3. clone it

Note: These files are not a part of your project and you shouldn't edit anything in them: `node_modules`, `.gitignore`, `.htmlhintrc`, `grading_script.sh`, `package-lock.json`, `package.json`. Bootstrap v4.5.3 `bootstrap.min.css` is included but you are not required to use bootstrap if you don't want to.

4. Start the project following the prompt in Epicenter! Use `main` branch for your final project. Can create other branches as needed. 


### Using the Grading Script

You may not know what each of these steps mean but that is okay. We will learn more about some of them later.

#### Steps:

1.  In your terminal, navigate to the top level directory of the project and type `npm install` (just once, you don't need to repeat this step again)

2. Grant yourself permission to run grading script (you should only have to do this once): 
  * run `chmod +x path/to/grading_script.sh` to grant yourself permission to execute this file.
  * If still have permission denied error, try `chmod u+x path/to/grading_script.sh` 

3. Run grading script (you can do this step as many times as you like to get updated feedback)
  * In your terminal, in the top level directory, run `./grading_script.sh`

#### About the Review.md doc:

After running the grading script, a file called `review.md` will appear in the top level directory of your project.

* Every time you run the grading script, the old file is deleted and a new file is created. At the top of the file is a time stamp that shows when the file was created.

* This file is added to your .gitignore file so it won't appear in your git history when you make changes to your project.

* You can run this file as many times as you need to get updated feedback. Please make sure all objectives are passing and there are no errors or warnings. If you're stuck please leave a note on what the issue is for your Teacher when submitting your project.

* Be aware that your Teacher may have additional resubmission requirements after review.
