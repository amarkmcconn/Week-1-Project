      <p>My name is Mark McConnell. I currently reside in Ridgefield, Wa with my wife Laura and our two huskies (Lana & Roma). I graduated from Oregon State University with a Business Adminstration degree. I've worked in various customer service positions and then started with Farmers Insurance. I worked for Farmers Insurance for about 6 years and held multiple titles throughout multiple departments. I then decided to make a career change as the insurance industry was no longer fulfilling. My career change led me to the construction field. I worked as a carpenter helper and then became a Journey Man Hazardous Material Handler. As a Hazardous material handler I worked with mainly with asbestos and lead. The two most prominent projects I worked on inclued: The USS Mercy (1000 bed Hospital) & Benson High School(Portland). I worked in the trades for two years and then decided that my body & health are important and that a career would be necessary to preserve both.</p>
