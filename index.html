            <p>My name is Mark McConnell. I currently reside in Ridgefield, WA with my wife, Laura, and our two huskies, Lana and Roma. I graduated from Oregon State University with a Business Adminstration degree. During and after my degree, I worked in various customer service positions. Ultimately, after working in customer service it led to a career with Farmers Insurance. I worked for Farmers Insurance for six years. During my time at Farmers, I worked in three different departments and I now have a robust knowledge of insurance. Following a car accident, I decided to make a career change as the insurance industry was no longer fulfilling. My career change led me to the construction field. I worked as a carpenter helper and then became a Journey Man Hazardous Material Handler. As a Hazardous material handler I worked mainly with asbestos and lead. The two most prominent projects I worked on included The USS Mercy (1000 bed Hospital) and Benson High School in Portland, OR. I worked in the trades for two years and then decided that my body and health are important and that a another career change would be necessary to preserve both. So here I am!
